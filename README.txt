# AdGame
A test build of code for learning how to write a game.

Download, extract and run the City of Thieves.exe inside the AdventureGame\bin\Debug folder.

This is a debug version and will remain as such until the game itself is complete.

Basic instructions for the game are as follows:
Press [Enter] to send commands and to continue the game when it pauses between screens.
At any decision process use numbers to select the option you want.
